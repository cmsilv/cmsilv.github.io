## About

Hi! My name is Will Bryant and I am currently a senior studying Computer Engineering at the Unversity of Michigan. I am pursuing a 5 year masters degree through Michigan's <a href=http://www.rackham.umich.edu/students/navigate-degree/sugs-information>SUGS</a> program. My current interests lie in distributed systems and operating systems, although I quickly get interested in any cool software projects that come my way!
