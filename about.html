## About

Hi my name is Curt Silverthorn and I am an aspiring software engineer! I will be graduating from the University of Michigan in May of 2018 with a bachelors degree in computer science and am excited to start working at AdvantageCS shortly thereafter. People always ask me what type of programming or software development interests me most and to be honest the answer is all of it! For me there is always a baseline level of enjoyment that comes from being able to solve problems and create new things. However, if your going to really push me I would say I am currently most interested in web applications, networks, and applications of aritificial intelligence. Outside of engineering I enjoy spending time in the great outdoors, and reading fantasy novels.<br> <br> Scroll down to learn more!
